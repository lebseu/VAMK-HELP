# VAMK.help
This application was implemented to utilize the Flask web framework to serve the services from the web crawler which could make requests to the servers of Winha or Tritonia and parse the HTML documents to get desired data, and the data would be processed further and exposed to the student in a decent way. 

The services were designed to include course reports, course calendars, Tritonia renewals, and GPA change notifications, automatic book renewals as additional services as well.
